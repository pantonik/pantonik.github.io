Hello, I'm Piotr, an Assosiate Professor at [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) ([Metz campus](https://metz.centralesupelec.fr)) with the LMOPS EA-4423 lab and the Chair in Photonics. My research activities combine machine learning, photonics, and FPGA programming, with applications in telecommunications, computer vision and biomedical imaging. My teaching duties span various topics in the engineering curriculum, from the basics of modelling, optimisation and electromagnetism up to more advaned topics such as photonic computing.
Besides science, I'm passionate about sports (such as cycling, esp. mountain biking, running and badminton), travelling and music.
More details can be found in my CV ??.
