A very nice thing about interdisciplinary research, at the intersection of machine learning, electronics and photonics, is the vast choice of interesting research directions. here are some of the most exciting research projects i'm pursuing

The goal of this project is to perform the human action recognition with photonic hardware. With my collaborators, we developped a large-scale photonic reservoir computer, using off-the-shelf components, and capable of running a neural network up to 16,000 nodes in parallel. The core of the experiment is the spatial light modulator, in charge of the nonlinear activation function. The input and readout layers are carried out digitally on a computer. Our first experiment achieved a 91% accuracy on the KTH dataset, with a processing speed up to 7 frames per second. We now aim at replacing the digital parts by optics to offload most of the computations in hardware and increase the processing speed up to real time.
